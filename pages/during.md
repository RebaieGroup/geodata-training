# 2.	During the live training


## 2.1	Objectives

The objectives of the live training sessions are:



1. To introduce QGIS, OSM, and Facebook data such as the High Resolution settlement Layer (HRSL).
2. To teach the participants how to utilize the technologies mentioned above in the work they are doing in disaster risk management and mitigation and health (e.g. COVID-19) response. The lessons/modules should be based on the pre-event training surveys.
3. To help the participants identify possible projects that they can do during the mentoring phase.


## 2.2	Programme curriculum

The Programme Curriculum is a resource that the participants can use beyond the training.

## 2.4	Training proper


### 2.4.1	Recording the training



* The live training sessions should be recorded.
* The two (2) trainers should record the training simultaneously.
    * To do this, the two trainers should both be hosts of the meeting.
* The recording may be stored on the cloud (using the provided Zoom account) or on the trainer’s local computer. In the case of the latter, the trainer should share a copy of the recording to OKF.


### 2.4.2	Curated questions



* Curate a list of questions (and answers to these questions) during the training. The Slack channel, a shared Google doc, or the Zoom messenger may be used for this.


### 2.4.3	Screenshare  and checking the status of participants



* During the exercises, the participants may be asked to share their screens to check if they are able to follow along with the exercises.
* During breakout sessions, you may ask the participant to share their screen and take the lead while doing the exercises.
* For  hands-on exercises, Zoom’s option to “Share multiple screens simultaneously” may be used by the trainers in order to check on the progress of each of the participants.
* Participants can also be asked to share a screenshot + short paragraph of where they are and what they found difficult at the end of an activity. The Slack channel may be utilized for this purpose.


### 2.4.4	Brainstorming projects for the mentoring phase



* Before the end of the live training sessions, the participants should have an idea of what projects they would like to do during the mentoring phase.
* Ideally, these projects should be done by group and should utilize the things they learned during the training.
* Additionally, having projects that are directly related to their day-to-day work is advised.


## Checklist after the training



1. Share training materials (presentations, data, etc.) with participants
2. Share training sessions recordings with participants
3. Participants have sample projects that they would like to complete during the mentoring phase
