# 4. 	Completing the programme


## 4.1	Finishing the projects



* In case some of the participants were unable to complete their projects and there is time allocated for the mentoring phase, this remaining time can be used to help the participants complete the projects even beyond the 4-week mentoring phase.
* Projects can be considered as:
    * Complete - the objectives of the project have been met and outputs are available
    * Partially complete - the project is more than halfway completed and needs a bit more time in order to complete
    * Incomplete - the project is still in its infancy and cannot be completed without a lot of work.
* In lieu of the projects, participants can also write a report about their learning experience. This report, if it includes all the necessary information, can be considered a substitute for a completed project.


## 4.2	Post-training survey



* The participants will be asked to complete a post-training survey asking about what they learned, what they liked, what can be improved, and what they plan to do with the knowledge they learned in the training.
* This survey can be administered during the final presentation if there is one.


## 4.3	Training retrospective



* A training retrospective with OKF will be scheduled after the training programme


## 4.4	Project Report (for each group)



* Final report by the participants about their projects, what they learned from the training, and how they plan to use what they learned in the future.
*


## 4.5	Final Report (by trainer/s)



* Final report by the trainer highlighting the outcomes and outputs of the training as well as providing a technical and narrative summary
*
